Education
======
* B.S. in college of life science, North East Agricultural University (NEAU), 2019
* Ph.D in Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies (SIAIS), ShanghaiTech University, 2024 (expected)

Representative Work
=====
* **GeminiMol**: a generic molecular representation model pre-trained on a miniaturized dataset (39,290), which incorporates conformational space profile into molecular representation learning. [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol)     
* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method, that can be applied to discovering novel PPIs, the rational design of molecular glues, and protein vaccines. Using the PPI-Miner, we developed the first potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of **molecular glue** degraders. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\] \[[**Online Database**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]   
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[**JMC**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320)\] \[[**APS**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]

Softwares and Databases
=====
* [**GeminiMol**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol), incorporating conformational space profile into molecular representation learning.
* [**GetPDB**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/Schrodinger-Script), downloading the single-chain protein structures for reverse docking or motif mining.
* [**PPI-Miner**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner), a motif driven PPI mining method.
* [**CRBN substrates library**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib), serving the rational design of the molecular glue.
* [**DeepSA**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/DeepSA/tree/main), assessing the synthetic accessibility of small molecules, filtering out the hard-to-synthesize molecules.

Service and Leadership
======
* The Initiator of Schrödinger Chinese Community.
* The Developer of [Bio-db](https://wang-lin-boop.github.io/Biodb-Search/) page.
