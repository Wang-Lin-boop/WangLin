Softwares and Databases
=====
* [**GetPDB**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/Schrodinger-Script), downloading the single-chain protein structures for reverse docking or motif mining.
* [**PPI-Miner**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner), a motif driven PPI mining method.
* [**CRBN substrates library**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib), serving the rational design of the molecular glue.
