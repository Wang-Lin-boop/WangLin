Brief Introduction
=====

I'm [**Lin Wang** \(王林\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a Ph.D. student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai \(白芳\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of life science of North East Agricultural University \(NEAU\) in 2019.    
    
My research interests center around the **rational design of small moleculal drugs and artificial proteins for therapeutic purposes**, with a particular focus on developing the molecular modulators of Protein-Protein Interaction \(PPI\). Additionally, I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular design in order to find new avenues for breakthroughs in drug design methodologies.   

Representative Works

* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\]
* The frist potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of the **molecular glue** degraders. \[[**Online Database**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320)\] \[[_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]

News
=====
1. 01/2023, we developed a highly sensitive model \([**DeepSA**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/DeepSA/tree/main)\) for assessing the synthetic accessibility of samll molecules, this work was done jointly by Shihang Wang \([王世航](https://shihang-wang-58.github.io/Shihang-Wang/)\) and me.
2. 12/2022, we have upgraded the original plmd script and renamed it to [**AutoMD**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/AutoMD), which supports more force fields and provides the ability to customize the trajectory analysis pipeline.
3. 11/2022, we developed a motif driven PPI mining method, named **PPI-Miner**. This methodology paper was published on [_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033), and source code was stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner).
4. CRBN is the most popular target for molecular glue and PROTAC protein degraders. In 08/2022, we released a **[database](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib) of potential substrates for CRBN**, which covers all human proteins that contain the β-hairpin loop and complementary surface with CRBN.
5. 08/2021, we found an allosteric drug binding pocket on Spike protein and designed allosteric inhibitors to prohibiting the conformational change of the Spike protein. This work was published on [_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320).
6. 08/2021, we identified five potential small molecular anti-virus blockers via targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and published this study on [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z).
7. 05/2021, I released a series of automated scripts for cross-docking \(**XDock**\), virtual screening \(**GVSrun**\), and molecular dynamics simulations \(plmd\) using the Schrödinger package, and stored the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/Schrodinger-Script).
8. 05/2020, I build an [user-friendly biomedical database-integration website](https://wang-lin-boop.github.io/Biodb-Search/) for accelerating literature research for drug development researchers.
9. 12/2019, I developed an automated script for downloading the single-chain protein structures by Uniprot ID, named [**GetPDB**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GetPDB).
