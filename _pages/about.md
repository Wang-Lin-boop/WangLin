Brief Introduction
=====

I'm [**Lin Wang** \(王林\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my Ph.D. degree at the ShanghaiTech University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Fang Bai \(白芳\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of life science of North East Agricultural University \(NEAU\) in 2019.    
    
My research interests are focused on **developing artificial intelligence methods for lead discovery** and applying them to design drugs for the treatment of **cancer, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic illnesses**. I have a particular interest in developing **molecular modulators for protein conformational changes and protein-protein interactions**. I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular representation learning and molecular design to revolutionize drug discovery approaches.    

Representative Works
=====
* **GeminiMol**: a generic molecular representation model pre-trained on a miniaturized dataset (39,290), which incorporates conformational space profile into molecular representation learning. [_BioRxiv_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.14.571629) [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol)    
* **PPI-Miner**: a motif-driven PPI identification method, that can be applied to discovering novel PPIs, the rational design of molecular glues, and protein vaccines. Using the PPI-Miner, we developed the first potential substrates database of CRBN, serving the rational design of **molecular glue** degraders. \[[_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033)\] \[[**Online Database**](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib)\]
* Discovery of **PPI disruptors** by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. \[[_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320) \| [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z)\]

News
=====
1. 12/2023, we have introduced the GeminiMol, which incorporates conformational space information into molecular representation learning, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol) and [_BioRxiv_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.14.571629).
2. 10/2023, DeepSA was published on [_Journal of Cheminformatics_](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00771-3), you can try it on our [DeepSA webserver](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa). 
3. 01/2023, we developed a highly sensitive model \([**DeepSA**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/DeepSA/tree/main)\) for assessing the synthetic accessibility of small molecules, this work was done jointly by Shihang Wang \([王世航](https://shihang-wang-58.github.io/Shihang-Wang/)\) and me.
4. 12/2022, we have upgraded the original plmd script and renamed it to [**AutoMD**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/AutoMD), which supports more force fields and provides the ability to customize the trajectory analysis pipeline.
5. 11/2022, we developed a motif driven PPI mining method, named **PPI-Miner**. This methodology paper was published on [_Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033), and source code was stored in [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner).
6. CRBN is the most popular target for molecular glue and PROTAC protein degraders. In 08/2022, we released a **[database](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib) of potential substrates for CRBN**, which covers all human proteins that contain the β-hairpin loop and complementary surface with CRBN.
7. 08/2021, we found an allosteric drug binding pocket on Spike protein and designed allosteric inhibitors to prohibiting the conformational change of the Spike protein. This work was published on [_Journal of Medicinal Chemistry_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320).
8. 08/2021, we identified five potential small molecular anti-virus blockers via targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and published this study on [_Acta Pharmacologica Sinica_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z).
9. 05/2021, I released a series of automated scripts for cross-docking \(**XDock**\), virtual screening \(**GVSrun**\), and molecular dynamics simulations \(plmd\) using the Schrödinger package, and stored the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/Schrodinger-Script).
10. 05/2020, I build an [user-friendly biomedical database-integration website](https://wang-lin-boop.github.io/Biodb-Search/) for accelerating literature research for drug development researchers.
11. 12/2019, I developed an automated script for downloading the single-chain protein structures by Uniprot ID, named [**GetPDB**](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GetPDB).
